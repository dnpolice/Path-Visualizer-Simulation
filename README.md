# Path Visualizer Simulation

Welcome to a Path Visualizer Sandbox. This is sandbox environment that visually shows you how a computer can solve any maze. The user can select the start, end and location of walls on a grid. Upon being ran, a breadth first search algorithm will complete while visually showing what was done. If the endpoint is reachable the shortest path from the start to end will be highlighted.
